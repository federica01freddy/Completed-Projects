## IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPEDANCE CONTROL FOR A TELE-ECHOGRAPHIC SYSTEM 

In our project, we were asked to implement impedance control for a manipulator with the future goal of remotely performing a commanded tele-echographic examination.
The simulated manipulator is equipped with an ultra-sound probe which will be in contact with an abdomen phantom.
Starting from an initial position above the phantom, the probe approaches the abdomen perpendicularly and then slides on it, keeping low contact forces.
