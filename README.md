# Master's degree projects
In this folder you will find all my projects developed during my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza, University of Rome from 2020 to 2023.
## Deep Learning
We developed several architectures that address the "Visual QA" which is a semantic task that aims to answer questions based on an image.These questions require an understanding of vision, language and commonsense knowledge to answer.\
We used the [Visual Q&A v2.0](https://visualqa.org/download.html) dataset which contains open-ended questions about images.
The developed architectures are:
* prior yes baseline
* random baseline 
* CNN + LSTM 
* LXMERT + GRU
