# Image Classification with Small Data
In this homework, you are invited to train image classifiers for a small data set.
## Objectives

- Train your favorite network architecture:
  - published one (e.g. ResNet, Wide ResNet, EfficientNetâ€¦)
  - custom one (note that published ones are a good starting point)

- Analyze results concerning few modifications of chosen architecture:
  - size (e.g., network depth/width)
  - layer configurations (e.g., kernel size, convolution stride)

- Analyze results concerning few modifications of optimization process:
  - optimizer (e.g. SGD, Adam, ...)
  - optimizer parameters (e.g. learning rate, weight decay, momentum)
  - training (e.g. epochs, batch size)

## Your Task
Add something in the code, save the trained model and evaluate it on the test set.

Examples:

- New architecture
- A different optimizer for training
- A choosable hyper-parameter (e.g., momentum parameter of SGD)

At least perform two of these tasks.
