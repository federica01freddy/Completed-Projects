## Learning strides in convolutional neural network
Implementation of “learning strides in convolutional neural network” paper. In addition we have implemented an additional task: from pytorch, write in tensorflow the
PHC layer implementation and use PHC layers in our project in the place of classic convolutional layers (paper: "lightweight convolutional neural
networks by hypercomplex parametrization").
